## Recent Changes & Preferences

### Design Decisions
1. **Navigation**: Removed site name from top-left header (kept it clean/minimal)
2. **Hero Section**:
   - Main text: "I am Cray Villarin" with glitch effect applied
   - Background: 3D head sculpture image (`assets/img/portfolio/shredder.png`)
   - Image positioned at `center 30%` to show the face properly
3. **Glitch Effect**:
   - Applied to main hero text only (not header)
   - RGB color split with cyan (#00fff9) and magenta (#ff00c1)
   - Continuous animation with skewing and clipping effects

### Code Clean-up
- Removed awkward "// Hello" comment that was outside proper HTML structure (line 4 of index.html)

## File Structure Notes
- Main HTML: `index.html`
- Main CSS: `assets/css/main.css`
- Images: `assets/img/` (portfolio images in `assets/img/portfolio/`)
- Key image: `assets/img/portfolio/shredder.png` (3D head sculpture used as hero background)

## Design Style
- Dark/cyberpunk aesthetic
- Glitch effects for modern tech feel
- Clean, minimal navigation
